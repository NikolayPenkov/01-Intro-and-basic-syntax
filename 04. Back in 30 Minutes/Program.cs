//Every time John tries to pay the bills he sees on the cash desk the sign: "I will be back in 30 minutes".One day John was tired of waiting and decided he needs a program, which prints the time after 30 minutes, so could come back after exactly 30 minutes. He is not able to write the program by himself, so he asks for help. 
//Input
//Two numbers are read from the console:
//•	The first number is hours and will be between 0 and 23.
//•	The second number is minutes and will be between 0 and 59.
//Output
//Print on the console the time after 30 minutes. The result should be in format hh:mm.The hours may contain one or two numbers and the minutes always have two numbers (with leading zero).

int hour = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
int minutes = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

int minutesPlusThirty = minutes + 30;

if (minutesPlusThirty >= 60)
{
    minutes = minutesPlusThirty - 60;
    hour++;
    if (hour > 23)
    {
        hour = 0; 
    }
}
string resutl = ($"{hour}:{minutes}");
Console.WriteLine(resutl);
